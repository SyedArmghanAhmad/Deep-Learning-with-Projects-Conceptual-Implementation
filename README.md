## üèóÔ∏è Included Architectures  

1. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**:  
   - Used for structured data tasks like classification and regression.  
   - Examples: Predicting house prices, classifying customer churn.  

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**:  
   - Designed for image-related tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation.  
   - Examples: Classifying handwritten digits (MNIST), identifying objects in CIFAR-10.  

3. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**:  
   - Enhanced RNN for long-term dependencies in sequences.  
   - Examples: Sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and machine translation.
